Over the past several years, I have always looked for opportunities to help navigate young people through their education and life's journey. I've volunteered as an orientation leader during my undergraduate degree to ensure first-year students had someone to help navigate a critical time in their lives. It is really important for young women in particular to feel that they have someone to talk to and lean on when needed. Currently, I also return to the University of Guelph often to attend alumni events to ensure new graduates feel supported in finding their first job.
