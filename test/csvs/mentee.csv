It wasn't that thought provoking, but the storyline had so much action. I finished it with a plot twist, and then realized how entertaining it was. After that, I wrote about the dreams I had with their interesting concepts. It had all been forgotten as I got older, and I was busier with school. At the end of grade 8, I had to do a project on my passions, and I forgot about how many hobbies and interests I had. I got an assignment to write some stories (fantasy genre this time) and I remembered how much I loved writing stories. I started writing more after that. A bunch of stories with interesting, unique plots and characters that I've made. I reread them again and again, and it had the same excitement and the emotions were just as strong.   ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",Other (please specify),"I would like to have more confidence, industry knowledge, experience and also finish this with a clear goal of what I want career I want / what I want  to do with my life."
