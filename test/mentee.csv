Although I personally want to pursue a career in Biomedical Engineering, I also want to fix my career goals on establishing a brand of my own. I have always been artistic and have wanted to pursue a career where I could integrate my passion for the arts and science.

When I was younger I was often told by relatives that as a girl I had certain duties and responsibilities and I would not amount to much however, I wasn’t phased by these remarks as my parents always told to work hard and strive for success. It wasn’t until I reached middle school that I realised these remarks weren’t that of adults but also my peers. I’ve had female and male peers disregard my achievements and success to merely something I received for being a girl. Often my peers would also tell me that this success wouldn’t carry out into the future as girls weren’t meant to work in fields of technology etc. This then led to me developing a lack of confidence and a low self-esteem. Given that my entire life I was told girls had a certain role I was also told they had to look a certain way. As someone who has always been overweight, the way I look has always made me uncomfortable. Although now, I am working towards appreciating the way I look, these thoughts have always prevented me from taking initiative to talk to people or in front of a crowd as I’ve always had thoughts of how people would perceive me. Furthermore, coming from a household where my household is financed by only one parent, I have always been wary of my spendings. Although my parents have always provided well for my family and I, I knew that there was a limitation as to how much I could do. However, I am grateful for organizations like GEM that have allowed me to take part of them for no cost.","I hope that with GEM I will be able to connect with individuals like me as well as seek guidance from my mentor. I want to be able to open up about the issues that I face and find solutions.Although, the issues I face may not be the same as my mentor I believe that with a I will be able to listen to their struggles and how they overcame them and draw inspiration from them. I also believe that with a mentor I will be able to gain immense knowledge, not only about the industry I’m interested in but also life skills that may be valuable in my future.

Growing up in a South Asian household with strong female leadership,  the expectation to excel in school was a requirement instilled in me from a very young age. Stress and mental health is always a barrier for me since I grew up in a house where you have the mindset of excellence; meaning, I have to do well academically to become successful in the future, as my parents do not have many resources to help. This is most evident in the financial department. Sometimes my mental health takes a toll on me when things arents going well since mental health is not seen as an issue in our culture causing individuals (like me) to bottle up our emotions and to ignore them. Low confidence and low self-esteem also are also an issue to me since I go to a demographically caucasian high school, which causes me to feel as if I do not fit in and can not relate to things in my school for example not joining clubs since I feel like I won’t fit in. Moneywise, my family always tries to make ends meet, however when I try to join clubs or anything of the sort that requires money it is not always available to me, as we can not afford it. When university comes, I will have a hard time paying the tuition since my parents will not be able to help me. I will have to take OSAP, and worry about paying back a huge set of loans. Lastly, in terms of lack of opportunity, the careers that I would like to go into, for example, veterinary medicine, zoology, and etc. are not always an easy opportunity to come by which makes it hard.",I hope to come out with more confidence and to have gained great knowledge and skills from this mentoring relationship!,Yes,Halal food only,,N/A,Fathers Name,Father,647-555-9999,Email ,Name ,Mother,416-999-8383,k.o@gmail.com,Name,416-999-8383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of my hobbies is creating arts and crafts. I enjoy using materials that I could find in my house to transform it into something useful or decorative. This activity often acts as a challenge or puzzle for me to solve and allows me to express myself more freely after a long time of studying for a certain subject. Another hobby of mine is reading literature such as biographies, novels, and short stories when I feel that I need a break from anything stressful. I enjoy reading especially after I have submitted an assignment or finished writing a test. It allows me to use my imagination to explore stories of characters varying from thoughts to values and beliefs. I can also gain more perceptions on issues from reading certain literature about traumatic pasts such as in the book A Thousand Splendid Suns written by Khaled Hosseini or overcoming fears in the novel I am Jazz by Jazz Jennings. To continue, I enjoy sketching and painting because it teaches me many skills such as patience when I concentrate on performing the task. I usually spend an hour and a half a week on painting or drawing because it can distract me from thinking about anything negative or stressful that has happened in school for the past week.",Gender discrimination,,,Bullying ,,Racial inequality ,,,,,,,"Barriers such as my lack of confidence, lack of self-esteem, and stress caused me to miss many opportunities and achievements whether it is in school or for my wellbeing. For instance, during my elementary school graduation, all grade eight students were allowed to compete for the role of both the emcee and valedictorian. The students were given the option to vote for their favourite candidate based on a speech the candidates would give in front of all the grade eight students. Even though my teacher told me that I had a great chance at succeeding to become the emcee for the ceremony, I told myself that I was not able to do it based on my popularity and inability to write a good speech. I thought of many issues that would occur and the outcome of failure resulting in my inability to even sign up to compete. From this experience, I missed many valuable things such as improving my public speaking skills or simply a remembrance for the future. Other times, stress always caused me to overreact and I would be anxious when I think about all of my due dates. It has prevented me from reaching my full potential when I use too much time to overthink the situation instead of resolving the issue.","As an introvert throughout my whole life, it usually defined who I am whether in school or the “real world.” Sometimes, I would use my personality as an excuse to avoid talking in classes or engaging in conversations with classmates that I’m unfamiliar with. From this opportunity at GEM, I wish to become more outgoing by meeting more people who share common interests and goals as me. I can be encouraged to use the opportunity to listen to their stories and open up to them about myself, spurring me to step out of my comfort zone. With guidance from a mentor, I wish to understand how to communicate with clients or fellow employees in the workplace. I can use the mentor experience to practice doing so based on my personality as an introvert. Furthermore, from the mentoring relationship, I wish that it could encourage me to decrease the mental barriers that I have to become more successful instead of always questioning myself. I hope that my mentor can teach me how to have more reassurance in myself by using her personal experiences to help me boost my confidence levels. From this opportunity, I also want to have a positive outlook on the events I am experiencing instead of always drawing negative conclusions to what will happen because it discourages me to do my best or I would feel defeated much more easily.",Yes,,,N/A,Fathers Name,Father,647-555-9999,Email ,Name ,Mother,416-999-8383,k.o@gmail.com,Name,416-999-8383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
